        <h1>Privacy Policy for AppLock</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 4, 2026</p>

        <p>
            This privacy policy explains how AppLock ("we", "our", or "the app") collects, uses,
            and protects your information when you use our voice-based app locking application.
        </p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Important:</strong> AppLock is designed with privacy in mind. All voice processing
            happens locally on your device. We do not collect, store, or transmit your voice recordings
            to any external servers.
        </div>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>AppLock collects and processes the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Voice Data:</strong> When you use voice unlock, your device's microphone captures
            audio input temporarily for speech recognition purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>App Lock Settings:</strong> The list of apps you choose to lock and their
            associated unlock phrases are stored locally on your device.</li>
            <li><strong>App Usage Detection:</strong> The app monitors which apps are opened to determine
            when to show the lock screen (processed entirely on your device).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>The information collected is used exclusively for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Voice Recognition:</strong> Audio input is processed in real-time using Android's
            built-in speech recognition service to match against your predefined unlock phrase.</li>
            <li><strong>App Locking:</strong> Your app lock settings are used to determine which apps
            require voice authentication.</li>
            <li><strong>Security:</strong> Session management ensures apps stay unlocked only during
            your current usage session.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>No Data Transmission:</strong> Your voice recordings and app lock settings are NEVER
            transmitted to our servers or any third parties. All processing happens locally on your device.
        </div>

        <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Storage Only:</strong> All app settings and unlock phrases are stored
            locally in your device's secure storage using Android SharedPreferences.</li>
            <li><strong>Voice Data:</strong> Voice recordings are processed in real-time and immediately
            discarded. No voice data is stored on your device or transmitted externally.</li>
            <li><strong>Session Data:</strong> Unlock sessions are stored temporarily in device memory
            and cleared when you switch apps or restart your device.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Permissions Required</h2>
        <p>AppLock requires the following Android permissions to function:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Microphone (RECORD_AUDIO):</strong> Required to capture voice input for
            voice-based unlocking. Audio is processed locally and immediately discarded.</li>
            <li><strong>Accessibility Service:</strong> Required to detect when locked apps are opened
            and to monitor app switches. This service does not collect or transmit any data.</li>
            <li><strong>Display Over Other Apps (SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW):</strong> Required to show the
            lock screen overlay over locked apps.</li>
            <li><strong>Battery Optimization Exclusion:</strong> Ensures the app continues monitoring
            even when in the background.</li>
            <li><strong>Query All Packages:</strong> Required to display the list of installed apps
            for you to choose which ones to lock.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            AppLock uses Android's built-in speech recognition service (Google Speech Services) for
            voice processing. When you speak to unlock an app, the audio may be processed by Google's
            speech recognition engine according to
            <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            We do not integrate any other third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>
            We do not share, sell, or disclose your personal information to any third parties.
            All data remains on your device.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            AppLock does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
            The app is intended for general audiences and does not target children.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have full control over your data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access:</strong> All your app lock settings are visible within the app.</li>
            <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can unlock any app or clear all settings by uninstalling
            the app, which removes all locally stored data.</li>
            <li><strong>Control:</strong> You can revoke permissions at any time through your device's
            Settings app.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this
            page with an updated "Last updated" date. Continued use of the app after changes
            constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
            App lock settings and unlock phrases are retained on your device until you:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Manually unlock an app within the AppLock interface</li>
            <li>Clear the app's data through Android Settings</li>
            <li>Uninstall the app</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Voice recordings are never retained - they are processed in real-time and immediately discarded.
        </p>
